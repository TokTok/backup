Your Tox instance would stop all the processing and responding to network requests, so to others it would seem as if you suddenly lost the Internet connection and you will eventually time out and be shown as offline on their end.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go offline immediately however, without others still seeing you as being online until some timeout amount of time passes on their end, the Tox instance would need to send packets to others telling that it's shutting down, which is done only when the Tox instance is destroyed, there is no option to send those without destroying it. What you can do in this case to still access the Tox struct is re-create it back after destroying it but with network settings that prevent it from connecting to anything. So before you destroy the Tox instance you would call `tox_get_savedata()` to save its state, then destroy the Tox instance, then create a new Tox instance off the saved state, with UDP and LAN discovery options disabled and a bogus proxy that Tox would fail to connect to specified, avoiding calling any bootstrap/add_tcp_relay function calls as that would be pointless without a network.",

Notify other clients quickly about your going offline.\r\n4. (maybe?) Quickly reconnect to the network when going back online.\r\n\r\nThe 4th requirement means you will need to reopen those ports/sockets and rebuild the network connections, which will take around 10 seconds (regular bootstrap). Overall, you can achieve everything except 1) by doing `tox_get_savedata` (which stores some DHT endpoints so it can quickly bootstrap back into the network), then `tox_kill` (closes sockets and tells clients about going offline), and then `tox_new` with the saved DHT nodes.\r\n\r\nSo the question remains: why do you want the struct to remain alive?\r\n\r\nAn alternative question might be, since you're looking for a feature to be added to toxcore: do you want a function in toxcore that implements the method I described above?",

This is something usually implemented in clients rather than in toxcore.

If so, depending on how the service you use exactly works, you might not need to open any ports as Tox does NAT hole-punching, and in the case that doesn't work, you could use a TCP relay.\r\n\r\n>I would like my program to be able to create messages but not send them. Just like thunderbird https://www.thunderbird.net/ .\r\n\r\nJust want to make sure you understand that Tox doesn't work like email. Tox doesn't support offline/asynchronous messaging. For your messages to be sent, both the sender and the receiver have to be online at the same time. Sender sends messages directly to the receiver, there is no intermediary that will hold sender's messages and relay them to the receiver once they are online. If the receiver or the sender (or both) are offline, no message can be sent or received.\r\n\r\n>I can write a dozen emails and only when I have the network on, or when I realistically hit the exchange button only then do I send and receive data.\r\n\r\nToxcore won't let you queue up messages to be sent while you or the receiver are offline, it's designed to send the messages right away. If you need such a message queue, that's something you have implement on top of Toxcore in your own code.",
