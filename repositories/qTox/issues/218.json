At the moment I am not sure though if there are some non-portable features which would be a stopper. There are quite a lot of instances of Qt5 syntax which can be more or less trivially substituted with Qt4-compatible code (say, there is a library to provide QJson* classes for Qt4). While I am nowhere an expert in Qt, I could do this part. If there are less trivial issues, I will need some help on that though.\r\n\r\nIs anyone aware of the current status of the codebase in this regard, in principle? \r\n\r\nOlder qmake files had remnants of Qt4 here, but it is not clear if anyone ever actually built it with Qt4. Did it work with Qt4 at some point of time, or the code was only tested with Qt5? If at least an ancient version has been known to work, it will make the task somewhat easier.\r\n\r\n### Contribution\r\n\r\n- [X] I would like to contribute to this feature",

Have a look at https://github.com/qTox/qTox/commit/8ae3c9f0c9d3151a977554309b2203f3b464b8ca to see what it entailed to migrate from Qt5 to Qt6. All of that code will have to be `#if QT4 ... #else ... #endif`. I'm not convinced it's worth the added maintenance cost. If you have a nice way of supporting Qt4 and Qt6 at the same time, I'm open to discuss this, but I'm not very optimistic about it.\r\n\r\nYou may want to look at [tomato](https://github.com/Green-Sky/tomato) by @Green-Sky which has a lot fewer dependencies and should be significantly more portable.",

Last time I gave it a go, I could fix qtbase with X11 on Sonoma (just the build, no idea how much more will be needed to get it to work properly), but powerpc build got stuck on an obscure error with stuff pulled in from Apple headers, and I left it there. It is probably fixable with a reasonable effort, but qtbase is not sufficient pretty much for anything, and stuff like qtwebengine will never be fixed (broken even on OpenBSD ppc, AFAIK, and there are more people doing something there than on Darwin).\r\nQt4 is probably sufficient for every need besides modern web-browsing, but I can imagine that it is non-trivial to maintain compatibility with it: Qt upstream did everything to make it painful LOL",

SDL may work (via X11), GTK4 is buggy, but has some chances. Qt5+ will require a lot of work with an unpredictable result – since there are no existing examples of something working with it on macOS ppc (for obvious reasons).",
